                The term "Phong lighting" refers to a reflection model.
                It describes the way a surface reflects light, taking into consideration three major
                components -
                ambient, diffuse and specular. The diffuse component models rough surfaces and the specular
                component
                models shiny ones.

                The term "Phong shading" is an interpolation technique for surface shading.
                It interpolates surface normals across rasterized polygons, allowing us to compute pixel
                colors
                based on the interpolated normals and a reflection model.

                In flat shading, every fragment belonging to the polygon gets the same color,
                since the basis for the calculation is just the angle between the polygon and the light
                source.
                The resulting shading is not smooth, and grid-like patterns can emerge if shaded
                surfaces are not very dense. This model allows for high computationally efficiency,
                since there is no
                interpolation taking place.

                Gouraud shading interpolates lighting values calculated for every vertex (as opposed to
                interpolating surface normals
                as in Phong shading). This results in a rather smooth shading (no sudden changes in color
                between polygons like in flat
                shading). However, lighting is not very realistic unless large amounts of vertices are used.
                It can be considered "middle ground" between flat and Phong shading, offering better quality
                then flat shading, while
                also being much cheaper to compute then Phong shading.
                <br><br>
                Phong shading offers the most realistic results of the three, but also comes with the
                highest computational
                overhead - since we interpolate surface normals, the lighting calculations take place in the
                fragment
                shader and thus, have to be done for each pixel.

                With a directional light, the light vector has the same value for every vertex, simplifying
                calculations. It is meant to simulate light coming from the sun or other distant light
                sources. Point light on the other hand allows us to take distance into account during the
                rendering.

                The eye position matters when simulating highlight - the specular element in the Phong
                reflection model
                takes into consideration camera's position, so it can simulate light being reflected into
                the eye of the camera.

            <li>
                This disables the specular component, resulting in only ambient and diffuse lighting being
                applied.

                A higher shininess value leads to a more pronounced and smaller specular highlight, 
                creating the perception of a shinier and smoother surface.
