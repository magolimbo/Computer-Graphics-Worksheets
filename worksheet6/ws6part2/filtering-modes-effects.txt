-Nearest Filtering (gl.NEAREST): Selects the nearest texel for sampling, creating a pixelated appearance.

    -influence on magnification: Results in a blocky, pixelated look when textures are magnified.
    -influence on minification: Can produce staircase artifacts, leading to jagged edges when textures are minified.



-Linear Filtering (gl.LINEAR): Calculates a weighted average of neighboring texels for smoother transitions

    -influence on magnification: Provides a smoother appearance during texture magnification.
    -influence on minification: Reduces aliasing artifacts. However Linear filtering has little effect on minification issues 



-Nearest Mipmap Nearest (gl.NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST): Selects the nearest mipmap level and uses the nearest texel within that level for sampling.

    -influence on minification: Reduces aliasing for minified textures by selecting appropriate mipmaps based on distance.


-Linear Mipmap Nearest (gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST): Applies linear interpolation within the nearest mipmap level for smoother transitions.

    -influence on minification: Reduces aliasing for minified textures by smoothly transitioning between mipmaps.


-Nearest Mipmap Linear (gl.NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR): Selects the nearest mipmap level and applies linear interpolation within that level.

    -influence on minification: Smoothens texture transitions during minification by blending texels in mipmaps.


-Linear Mipmap Linear (gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR): Combines linear filtering between texels and linear interpolation between mipmap levels.

    -influence on minification: Offers the best quality for minified textures, reducing aliasing issues.
