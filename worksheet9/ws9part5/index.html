               PROJECTION SHADOWS:<br>
               Advantages: simple to implement, without significant impact on performance.  <br>
               Disadvantages: projection shadows may lack detail when dealing with complex geometries. They may also struggle when objects cast shadows on themselves.

                SHADOW MAPPING:<br>
                Advantages: very precise and detailed, can handle self-shadowing. Can be adapted to various scenes and lighting conditions. <br>
                Disadvantages: can suffer from aliasing, requires the extra computational step of calculating the shadow map.
