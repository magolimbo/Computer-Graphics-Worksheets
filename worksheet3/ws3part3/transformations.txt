Reflect on the theory of affine transformations and viewing
transformations by doing the following:
• List the transformation matrices that you used in Parts 1 and 2
(use general expressions/functions rather than concrete
numbers). [Angel 4.9, 5.3-5.5]
• For each cube, write down a formula showing how the matrices
were concatenated to become the current transformation matrix
(CTM) that was used to transform the vertices in the vertex
shader. [Angel 4.10-4.11]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1:   
    -View Matrix (V):  V = lookAt(eye, at, up)
    -Projection Matrix (P): not explicitly defined (the default orthographic projection has been used)
    -Model Matrix (M): not explicitly defined (default cube)

    The CTM is calculated as follows: CTM = V 


Part 2:
    Cube 1 (1 point perspective):
        -View Matrix (V): V = lookAt(eye, at, up)
        -Projection Matrix (P): P = perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far);
        -Model Matrix (M): M = mat4(1);

    Cube 2 (2 point perspective):
        -View Matrix (V): V = translate(-1.5, 0.0, 0.0)
        -Projection Matrix (P): P = perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far);
        -Model Matrix (M): M = mat4(1);

    Cube 3 (3 point perspective):
        -View Matrix (V): V = mult(mult(rotateX(angx), rotateY(angY)), translate(x,y,z))
        -Projection Matrix (P): P = perspective(fovy, aspect, near, far);
        -Model Matrix (M): M = mat4(1);
    

    The CTM is calculated as follows: CTM = P * V * M
